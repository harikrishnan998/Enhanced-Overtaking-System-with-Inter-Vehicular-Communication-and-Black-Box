Enhanced Overtaking Management System with Inter-Vehicular Communication and Black Box addresses critical challenges associated with overtaking maneuvers, focusing on safety enhancement through the integration of Inter- Vehicular Communication (IVC) and Black Box technology. Overtaking on bridges is dangerous due to the increased risk of collisions with oncoming traffic and the limited visibility caused by large vehicles ahead further complicates the problem.

The project includes overtaking detection in bridges , a chat app that allows the driver to communicate with others drivers for requesting and granting permission to overtake and a black box . Enhanced Overtaking Management System with Inter-Vehicular Communication and Black Box helps to identify the traffic violators in bridges and reports them, it also guides the drivers for a safe overtake with minimal risk and in case of a worst case scenario if an accident occurs the black box helps to identify what really happened.
